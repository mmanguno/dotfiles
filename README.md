# dotfiles

Contains all significant dotfiles for my command-line setup.

### DISCLAIMER

This repo's main use is to act as a backup for my system that I can quickly restore to. So know that I have written very little of this code. This disclaimer is mainly for the `.emacs.d/` directory, of which I have only written all files within the `inits/` directory and 'init.el'. The other files are all the property of their respective owners. So no, I have not written 100,000 lines of Emacs Lisp.

### Includes:
+ `.bash_profile`
+ `.bashrc`
+ `.emacs.d/`
+ `.nanorc`
+ `.sbclrc`
+ `.vimrc`
+ `.gvimrc`
+ `.zshrc`

Also, includes my Z-Shell theme `lycurgus`, a modified version of the `avit` theme by [Andrew Vit][1].
